Cross-compilation toolchain for the DNS-323
-------------------------------------------

This repository contains the environment to build an ARM cross-compilation
toolchain to generate binaries for D-Link's DNS-323 NAS. With this toolchain
you'll be able to compile programs that can be run directly on the DNS-323.
This environment has been extracted from the uclibc tarball from the GPL source
code that D-Link provides at:
ftp://gpl.dlink.com/DNS-323/dns323_GPL_v1.08_12182009.tgz
I made some minor tweaks to fix a problem that prevented the toolchain from
creating dynamically linked binaries. I also extended the env to download,
build, and install libz (within the toolchain tree) which is required if you
want to use the toolchain to build, e.g., dropbear. Note that there are more
shared libraries installed on the DNS-323 than this toolchain provides.


Prerequisites
-------------

You need to use gcc 3.x or an early 4.x version to be able to compile the
toolchain. A later gcc 4.x won't work and will produce an error during
compilation of the toolchain's gcc.


Compile the toolchain
---------------------

As simple as the following :-)

$ git clone git@github.com:juergh/toolchain_arm.git
$ cd toolchain_arm
$ make

The first step of the compilation process will download the source code of the
different packages into the directory sources/dl, so might take a while
depending on the speed of your internet connection.


Test the toolchain
------------------

After successful compilationm, source the envrionment variables and compile the
test program:

$ source toolchain_arm/build-env
$ make test

Which should produce the following output:

make[1]: Entering directory `/home/juergh/Projects/dns-323/toolchain_arm/test'
arm-linux-uclibc-gcc -Wall -s -Os -mtune=arm9e -march=armv5te   -c -o hello.o 
   hello.c
arm-linux-uclibc-gcc -o hello hello.o
hello: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, version 1, dynamically linked
   (uses shared libs), not stripped
 0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libc.so.0]

Note the architecture of the executable (ARM) and that it's dynamically linked
against uclibc.


Install the toolchain
---------------------

Copy/move the directory tree toolchain_arm/toolchain_arm to wherever you want
to. Don't forget to source toolchain_arm/build-env before you attempt to
compile a program for the DNS-323.
